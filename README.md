# Linux Handbook
This is a cheat sheet for Linux commands and Linux workflows.

## Common Concepts
### Networking
#### 1. Socket Vs Port:
- Port → A number that identifies a specific service or application on a machine (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 5432 for PostgreSQL).
- Socket → The actual communication endpoint, which combines:
  + IP address (which machine)
  + Port number (which service)
  + Protocol (TCP/UDP)
##### Analogy:
- Port = a room number in a building.
- Socket = the door to that room that’s actually open for someone to walk through and talk.
  
#### 2. TCP6 & UDP6
TCP6 and UDP6 are not new protocols. They are the same TCP and UDP protocols running over IPv6 instead of IPv4.<br>
**They only say that the socket is using IPv6.**

## Common Commands
### Networking
#### 1. List all listening network sockets on your machine and which process owns them.
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn
```
Example output:
```

##### Columns:
1. **Proto** → Protocol of the socket. (Eg. tcp, udp, tcp6, udp6)
2. **Recv-Q** (Receive Queue) → Number of bytes received by the kernel but not yet read by the application. Usually ```0``` if the application is keeping up. High numbers can indicate the process isn’t reading data fast enough.
3. **Send-Q** (Send Queue) → Number of bytes sent by the kernel but not yet acknowledged by the remote side. Usually ```0``` for LISTEN sockets. Large numbers could indicate network congestion or a stalled connection.
4. **Local Address** → The IP and port on your machine that the process is listening on.
Examples:
- ```127.0.0.1:323``` → localhost only, port 323.
- ```0.0.0.0:5353``` → all IPv4 interfaces, port 5353.
- ```:::15432``` → all IPv6 interfaces, port 15432.
5. **Foreign Address** → The IP and port of the remote endpoint. For LISTEN sockets, it’s usually 0.0.0.0:* or :::*, because it’s waiting for any connection. For active connections (ESTABLISHED), it would show the client IP:port.
6. **State** → Current state of the socket.
Common ones:
- ```LISTEN``` → Waiting for incoming connections.
- ```ESTABLISHED``` → Active connection exists.
- ```CLOSE_WAIT```, ```SYN_SENT```, etc. → Various TCP states.
Only TCP has states; UDP usually shows blank because it’s connectionless.
7. **PID/Program name** → The PID(Process ID) and program owning the socket. Format: PID/ProgramName.
Example:
- ```128/systemd-resolve``` → PID ```128``` is ```systemd-resolve```.
- ```-``` → PID unknown, often because it’s kernel-level or restricted namespace.
