# Linux Handbook
This is a cheat sheet for Linux commands and Linux workflows.

## Common Concepts
### Networking
#### 1. Socket Vs Port:
**Socket (Formal Definition)**: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.<br>
**Port (Formal Definition)**: A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.

Simply,
- Port ‚Üí A number that identifies a specific service or application on a machine (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 5432 for PostgreSQL).
- Socket ‚Üí The actual communication endpoint, which combines:
  + IP address (which machine)
  + Port number (which service)
  + Protocol (TCP/UDP)

##### Analogy:
- Port = a room number in a building.
- Socket = the door to that room that‚Äôs actually open for someone to walk through and talk.
  
#### 2. TCP6 & UDP6
TCP6 and UDP6 are not new protocols. They are the same TCP and UDP protocols running over IPv6 instead of IPv4.<br>
**They only say that the socket is using IPv6.**

#### 3. Network Interface
**Network Interface (Formal Definition)**:  A network interface is the defined boundary, both physical and logical, through which a host system exchanges data with a network.

A network interface is basically a ‚Äúconnection point‚Äù between your computer and a network.
- It can be physical (like an Ethernet port or Wi-Fi card) or virtual (like loopback lo, Docker bridge, or VPN adapters).
- Each interface has an IP address, which identifies it on that network.
- Examples on Linux:
  - lo ‚Üí Loopback (127.0.0.1), for internal communication.
  - eth0 ‚Üí Physical Ethernet card.
  - wlan0 ‚Üí Wi-Fi adapter.
  - docker0 ‚Üí Docker‚Äôs virtual network.

##### Analogy:
- Think of your computer as a house.
- Network interfaces are the doors/windows that let it connect to the outside world.
- Each door (interface) can have its own address, so people know where to send data.
üí° So when a socket binds to ```0.0.0.0```, it‚Äôs like saying: *‚ÄúListen on all doors/interfaces‚Äù*.

## Common Commands
### Networking
#### 1. List all listening network sockets on your machine and which process owns them.
```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn
```
Example output:
```

##### Columns:
1. **Proto** ‚Üí Protocol of the socket. (Eg. tcp, udp, tcp6, udp6)
2. **Recv-Q** (Receive Queue) ‚Üí Number of bytes received by the kernel but not yet read by the application. Usually ```0``` if the application is keeping up. High numbers can indicate the process isn‚Äôt reading data fast enough.
3. **Send-Q** (Send Queue) ‚Üí Number of bytes sent by the kernel but not yet acknowledged by the remote side. Usually ```0``` for LISTEN sockets. Large numbers could indicate network congestion or a stalled connection.
4. **Local Address** ‚Üí The IP and port on your machine that the process is listening on.
Examples:
- ```127.0.0.1:323``` ‚Üí localhost only, port 323.
- ```0.0.0.0:5353``` ‚Üí all IPv4 interfaces, port 5353.
- ```:::15432``` ‚Üí all IPv6 interfaces, port 15432.
5. **Foreign Address** ‚Üí The IP and port of the remote endpoint. For LISTEN sockets, it‚Äôs usually 0.0.0.0:* or :::*, because it‚Äôs waiting for any connection. For active connections (ESTABLISHED), it would show the client IP:port.
6. **State** ‚Üí Current state of the socket.
Common ones:
- ```LISTEN``` ‚Üí Waiting for incoming connections.
- ```ESTABLISHED``` ‚Üí Active connection exists.
- ```CLOSE_WAIT```, ```SYN_SENT```, etc. ‚Üí Various TCP states.
Only TCP has states; UDP usually shows blank because it‚Äôs connectionless.
7. **PID/Program name** ‚Üí The PID(Process ID) and program owning the socket. Format: PID/ProgramName.
Example:
- ```128/systemd-resolve``` ‚Üí PID ```128``` is ```systemd-resolve```.
- ```-``` ‚Üí PID unknown, often because it‚Äôs kernel-level or restricted namespace.
